This code conducts a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset using Python's Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib libraries. It begins by loading the Iris dataset from Seaborn and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure. Basic dataset details are reviewed, including its shape and missing values, followed by a statistical summary of numerical columns. The unique values in the categorical 'species' column are listed, and various visualizations are created: histograms to show the distribution of numerical features, a pairplot to explore feature relationships across species, and boxplots to compare sepal and petal lengths by species. The correlation matrix is calculated and visualized using a heatmap to show feature interrelationships. The dataset is then grouped by species to compute mean values for each feature, and finally, the cleaned dataset is saved to a CSV file. This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between features.
